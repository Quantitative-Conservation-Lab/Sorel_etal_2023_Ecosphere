## Main message {-}

Alternative juvenile life history pathways are associated with different survival rates and maturation ages, and respond differently to environmental variability, at subsequent life stages. 


## Working abstract  {-}

Life history diversity is thought to increase population productivity and stability. However, the lifetime demographic consequences of alternative life history pathways, especially alternative pathways exhibited by young animals, are rarely understood because it is difficult to track individuals throughout their life cycles. To understand how demographic outcomes differ among animals with different life history pathways, we analyzed a long-term mark-recapture data set for Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*). In this population, juveniles exhibit a two-stage emigration from natal streams; stage-one emigration is to downstream freshwater rearing areas and occurs within the first or second year of life, while stage-two emigration is to the ocean and occurs in the second spring of life. One life history pathway is characterized by fish remaining in the natal stream until their second spring of life and initiating stage-two emigration directly after stage one (natal stream-rearing). Other life history pathways are characterized by fish carrying out stage-one emigration from natal streams in spring, summer, or fall of their first year of life, and rearing and overwintering in downstream reaches prior to initiating stage-two emigration the following spring (downstream-rearing). Downstream-rearing fish initiated stage-two emigration (to the ocean) about twenty days earlier in their second spring on average and their survival rates during stage-two emigration were generally lower than natal stream-rearing fish. In addition, downstream-rearing fish returned as adults from the ocean at higher rates, but a higher proportion returned at younger ages than did natal stream-rearing fish. Environmental variability is known to play a role in maintaining life-history variability in populations, and we identified several important sources of environmental variability influencing this population. Survival of downstream-rearing fish in downstream-rearing habitats was negatively correlated with winter air temperature and stream discharge. Return rates of downstream-rearing fish as adults from the ocean was positively correlated with coastal upwelling in spring, but this was not the case for natal stream-rearing fish. Return rates of natal stream-rearing fish from the ocean was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature to a greater degree than downstream-rearing fish. Different responses to environmental variability among fish that exhibit alternative life history pathways should lead to asynchrony in adult abundance among juvenile life history pathways and increase population stability. Understanding differences in survival and maturation age of animals that exhibit different juvenile life history pathways leads to a more holistic conceptualization of the factors governing population productivity and stability, enabling more accurate predictions of the effects of management and climate change on populations.   
 
## Introduction outline  {-}



Life history diversity can reduce intraspecific resource competition, facilitate adaptation to changing conditions over time, and increase population stability. Organisms expressing alternative life history tactics often use habitat resources in different ways to survive, grow, and reproduce, increasing the niche space occupied by a population and enabling larger population sizes  [@Allen2008Offspring; @Day2000Competition; @SvanbÃ¤ck2007Intraspecific]. Animals exhibiting different life history pathways also often exhibit asynchronous trends in abundance contributing to population stability [(]@Hilborn2003Biocomplexity; @Morozov2013Revisiting]. Understanding the range of individual responses by organisms expressing different life history tactics to management or environmental change enables more mechanistic predictions of population responses, which may help with predicting responses to conditions outside the range experienced in the past, such as those projected to occur due to anthropogenic climate change. 
It is increasingly recognized that the condition of juvenile organisms effect demographic rates at later life stages, highlighting the importance of considering full life cycles to understand the drivers of life history and fitness [@Taborsky2006influence]. For example, the size and date of spadefoot toads (*Pelobates fuscus*) at metamorphosis is related to first-year survival and probability of reaching maturity, but toads expressing different life history tactics have similar lifetime fitness because the effects of metamorphosis date and size on survival and maturation age cancel each other out [@Schmidt2012From]. Lewin et al. [-@Lewin2017Juvenile] found that juvenile mass of female spotted hyenas (*Crocuta crocuta*) was associated with higher survival to reproduction. They further identified a positive relationship between juvenile concentrations of the growth hormone IGF-1 and age at first parturition but a negative relationship between juvenile IGF-1 and longevity in adulthood.  Understanding the interconnection of different life stages requires longitudinal data, which can be difficult to collect, which has resulted in considerable uncertainty remaining about how juvenile experiences affect lifetime fitness [@Clutton-Brock2010Individuals; @Metcalfe2001Compensation].


Anadromous  salmonids exhibit considerable life history diversity in terms of freshwater habitat use during juvenile life stages, which is associated with increased population stability [@Bourret2016Diversity; @Copeland2014importance; @Greene2010Improved; @Miller2010Quantifying; @Moore2012Trophic; @Phillis2018Endangered; @Schroeder2015Juvenile]. However, the degree to which juvenile life history affects demographic rates and their response to environmental variability in subsequent life stages, such as migration survival, maturation age, and lifetime reproductive success, is not well understood. Juvenile traits such as growth rate, size, and timing of ocean-entry are known to be related to survival and maturation age at subsequent life stages and to mediate relationships with environmental conditions [@Gosselin2018Conservation; @Scheuerell2005Influence; @Scheuerell2009Relating; @Wilson2021Phenological; @Zabel2004Relating]; however, considerable uncertainty remains about the role of juvenile life history diversity, specifically as it relates to rearing in alternative habitat types at different points in freshwater residency, in determining subsequent demographic rates and their relationships with environmental conditions [@Bourret2016Diversity].  This information has the potential to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the role of juvenile life history diversity in creating population stability in the face of environmental variability and to enable better prediction of responses to management actions and environmental change. 

To understand how lifetime demographic outcomes differ among animals with different juvenile life history pathways, we analyzed a long-term mark-recapture data set for >150,000 Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) in the Columbia River over 15 years. Detection of fish at multiple dams allowed for estimation of migration survival, maturation age, and return rates from the ocean. Because fish were marked as young animals, when their juvenile life history pathways were known, we could link their early life history pathway to later survival and its relationship with environmental covariates.

The Wenatchee River Basin is locoated in central Washington State, USA (`r fig_nums("map",display="cite")`). It supports a population of spring Chinook salmon, which spawn in tributaries of the mainstem of the Wenatchee River and in the upper-most reach of the mainstem. As is common among Chinook salmon, juveniles exhibit a two-stage emigration from natal streams [@Copeland2009Contribution; @Bourret2016Diversity]; stage-one emigration is to downstream freshwater rearing areas and occurs within the first or second year of life, while stage-two emigration is to the ocean and occurs in the second spring of life [@Buchanan2015Estimating]. One life history pathway is characterized by fish remaining in the natal stream until their second spring of life and initiating stage-two emigration directly after stage one (natal stream-rearing). Other life history pathways are characterized by fish carrying out stage-one emigration from natal streams in spring, summer, or fall of their first year of life, and rearing and overwintering in downstream reaches prior to initiating stage-two emigration the following spring (downstream-rearing). Adults return from the ocean in spring at age three, four, or five, hold within the Wenatchee River Basin over summer, and spawn in late summer.



### Data {-}

From 2006 through 2017, juvenile spring Chinook salmon were sampled with rotary screw traps upon emigration from three natal streams (stage-one emigration) â the Chiwawa River, Nason Creek, and the White River (`r fig_nums("map",display="cite")`). The traps were installed in early spring and operated continuously through late fall. Captured juveniles > 60 mm were implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags within their peritoneal cavity using a syringe. PIT tags transmit a unique radio-frequency identification (RFID) code when triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from an RFID reader device. Individuals <60 mm, which included most sub-yearling emigrants in spring and early summer, cannot be tagged without imposing an undue burden that would affect their survival.

Following initial capture, the first opportunity for detection occurred at a rotary screw trap operated near the confluence of the Wenatchee River and the Columbia River  (`r fig_nums("map",display="cite")`). We assumed that fish passed this screw trap during stage-two emigration in their second spring of life.  However, it is possible that some fish passed this screw trap as sub-yearlings (i.e., as part of stage-one emigration) in late summer through winter, when the trap is not operated. These fish would be unavailable for recapture during the second capture occasion, which could result in biased survival estimates if the unavailable fish had different survival rates than the available fish.

Because initial capture occurred at different times of year for fish exhibiting different life history pathways, and the second capture occasion occurred at the same time of year for all fish, the length of time between the first and second capture occasions differed among life history pathways. Thus, we expected heterogeneity in survival rates during this interval. Behavioral and physiological differences among life history pathways could result in heterogeneity in survival and maturation rate at subsequent life stages as well. To account for this, we categorized fish in our data set into three juvenile life history pathways based on the age of fish and day of year when they were captured at the first screw trap (i.e., when they emigrated from natal streams). These three life history pathways corresponded with those delineated in previous work (Chapter 1). The youngest emigrating juveniles from the natal stream, which emigrated in spring of their first year, were not represented in our dataset because they were too small to be marked. The youngest that we were able to sample (hereafter *summer sub-yearlings*), emigrated as sub-yearlings between days of year 141 and 262. The subsequent group of emigrants (*fall sub-yearlings*) emigrated as sub-yearlings between day of year 263 and when the traps were removed in early winter (DOY 345). The final group of emigrants (*spring yearlings*) emigrated as yearlings in spring, between days of year 53 and 179, and were distinguished from spring or summer sub-yearlings based on a previously developed length-date cutoff rule (Chapter 1). We treated fish with different juvenile life history pathways as different groups  in subsequent modeling.

The third and fourth capture occasions occurred at juvenile bypass systems at McNary and Bonneville Dams within the migration corridor (`r fig_nums("map",display="cite")`). Only juveniles that passed dams via the bypasses were detected, as there were no RFID readers in the spillways or the turbine penstocks. After passing Bonneville Dam as juveniles, fish entered the marine environment and could not be detected until they returned to Bonneville Dam as adults, one to three years later. The fifth and sixth capture occasions occurred at fish ladders at Bonneville and McNary Dams, which all adults must use to pass these dams. The seventh and final capture occasion occurred at the fish ladder at Tumwater Dam on the mainstem of the Wenatchee River, which all fish must pass to return to their natal streams. The dates and locations that marked fish were released and subsequently recaptured in the screw trap or at dams were downloaded from the Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System (www.ptagis.org 2021 ).

### Model {-}

We used a multi-state mark-recapture model to estimate downstream survival ($\phi_{t,l,a,y}$) by interval ($t$), juvenile life history ($l$), stream ($a$), and year ($y$); upstream survival ($\phi_{t,y,s}$) by occasion, year, and age ($s$); and maturation probabilities ($\psi_{l,y,s}$) by life history, year, and age [@Arnason1973estimation, @Brownie1993Capture-Recapture]. Because fish could not be observed after passing downstream of Bonneville Dam unless they returned to Bonneville Dam one to three years later (occasion five), annual marine survival probabilities are non-identifiable. Instead, we modeled the probability of return, at any age, for all fish entering the ocean on a given year, and conditional on return, the probabilities of fish spending one, two, or three years at sea [returning at ages three through five; @Buhle2018Using]. 



#### Survival {-}

Survival probabilities were modeled  as,  

\begin{equation}
logit(\phi_{t,l,a,y,s})=\alpha_t + {\mathbf{x}_{t,l,a,y,s}}' \boldsymbol \beta + \delta_{t,y}+\epsilon_{t,l,y}
(\#eq:logitsurv)  
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_t$ is an occasion-specific intercept, $\mathbf{x}_{t,l,a,y,s}$ is a vector of covariates or categorical effects, $\boldsymbol \beta$ is a vector of coefficients, $\delta_{t,y}$ are synchronous random effects of year, and $\epsilon_{t,y,l}$ are random effects of year specific to each life history pathway. To improve parameter identifiability and the predictive ability of the model, we applied penalized-complexity priors on coefficients $\boldsymbol\beta$, and random year-effects $\delta_{t,y}$ and $\epsilon_{t,y,l}$, treating them as Gaussian random effects with an exponential prior on the standard deviations of their hypder-distributions,  



\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\boldsymbol \beta &\sim N(\mathbf 0,\boldsymbol \Sigma_{\beta})\\
\boldsymbol \Sigma_{\beta} &= diag(\boldsymbol \sigma^2_{\beta})\\
\boldsymbol \sigma_{\beta}&\sim exp(\lambda_1)\\
\delta_{t,y} &\sim N(0,\sigma_{\delta_t})\\
\epsilon_{t,y,l} &\sim N(0,\sigma_{\epsilon_{t,l}})\\
\sigma_{\delta_t},~\sigma_{\epsilon_{t,l}} &\sim exp(\lambda_2)\\
\end{split}
(\#eq:survpriors)  
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol\lambda$ determines the strength of the penalties [@Simpson2017Penalising]. To select values of $\boldsymbol\lambda$ we conducted a grid search where we fit the model with several different values and evaluated model performance based on the leave-one-out information criterion (looic) calculated with the looic package (Vehtari et al. 2020) in `r version$version.string`. We fit the model with candidate values of $\boldsymbol\lambda$ = `r paste0(round(-log(0.01)/(5:2/10),2),collapse = ", ")`, or `r round(-log(0.01)/.1,2)`, testing all 25 combinations of values for the two $\lambda$ values, where one value was for used for coefficients and another for random year effects. These corresponded with a 1% probability of the standard deviation being greater than 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1, respectively. For the looic calculations, we sampled parameter sets from a multivariate normal distribution defined by the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters and the inverted Hessian, and calculated the log-likelihood of each capture history for each parameter set to feed into to the *looic* function.


<!-- We selected values of $\lambda$ that allowed enough flexibility in the model to capture the variability in the data but no so much flexibility such that the model was overfit, which would sacrifice statistical power and potentially predictive skill. To do so, we began with by fitting the model with $\lambda$ = `r U_0<-.5;(round(pen_1<--log(.01)/U_0,2))` such that the probability of a random effect being greater than 1 was 0.01. The distribution of scaled quantile residuals (described in *goodness of fit* below) for this model were underdispersed relative to the expected uniform distribution suggesting that the model was overfit. Thus we increased the strength of penalties until the distribution of scaled quantile residuals were approximately uniform. This was achieved when we set $\lambda$ = `r U1<-.3;(round(pen_1<--log(.01)/U1,2))` such that the Prob($\sigma_{\beta^t}$>`r U1`) = 0.01. -->

<!-- and $\lambda^b$ = `r U2<-0.1;(round(pen_2<--log(.01)/U2,2))` such that the Prob($\sigma_{\delta^t},~\sigma_{\epsilon^t_l}$>`r U2`) = 0.01. -->

<!-- which resulted in a marginal standard deviation of approximately `r round(0.31*U1,2)` for  a given $\beta^t$. For the prior on the standard deviations of the hyper-distributions for the random year effects we used -->

<!-- , resulting in a marginal standard deviation for the a given $\delta^t$ or $\epsilon^t_l$ of approximately `r round(0.31*U2,2)` -->

<!-- We selected $\lambda^a$ = `r (pen_1<-10)` for the exponential prior on the standard deviations of hyper-distributions for random coefficients $\boldsymbol \beta^t$, which results in a marginal prior standard deviation of a random effect was approximately `r round((-log(0.01)/pen_1)*.31,2)` and a prior probability of 1% of a coefficient being greater than or equal to `r round(-log(0.01)/pen_1,2)`. We chose $\lambda^b$ = `r (pen_2<-20)` for such that the marginal prior standard deviation was approximately `r round((-log(0.01)/pen_2)*.31,2)` and a prior probability of 1% of a random year effect being greater than or equal to `r round(-log(0.01)/pen_2,2)`. -->


<!-- We selected values of lambda that resulted in goodness of fit diagnostics that indicated neither underdispersion nor overdispersion of residuals. In other words, we iteratively increased the strength of penalties until residual diagnostics indicated that we were adaquately fitting the data without overfitting.    -->





Juvenile life history pathway, natal stream, and adult age effects were coded with a sum constraint such that coefficients represented departures from occasion-specific means, and these departures were penalized with the prior defined in Equation \@ref(eq:survpriors)  (`r tab_nums("variables",display="cite")`). The exceptions were differences in survival among juvenile life history pathways and natal streams during the first interval, which were not penalized (i.e. treated as intercepts $\alpha_{1,l,s}$).  This was because fish expressing each juvenile life history pathway spent a different amount of time rearing prior to the second occasion and were therefore expected to have different survival rates. We did not penalize the effect of natal stream because fish from the White River must pass through Lake Wenatchee to reach the lower Wenatchee River screw trap (occasion two), which could affect survival considerably. During all subsequent survival intervals, we fit one unpenalized intercept per interval and penalized all other coefficients.

During the second and third survival intervals, representing downstream-emigration survival in the mainstem of the Columbia River, we assumed that fish that emigrated from their natal stream as sub-yearlings in summer and fall (*downstream rearing fish*) had the same survival rate as one another , due to their similar detection timing to one another on occasions two through four (`r fig_nums("timing",display="cite")`). This assumption was made to increase statistical power in light of the smaller sample sizes of summer sub-yearlings. We modeled effects of natal stream and natal stream interactions with juvenile life history pathway on survival in the first interval, whereas during intervals two and three we modeled natal stream affects and interactions with natal-stream vs downstream rearing life histories. During survival intervals two and three, we modeled idiosyncratic random year effects for natal-stream and downstream rearing life histories rather than including sperate random effects for summer and fall sub-yearling life histories as in interval one.
<!-- (`r tab_nums("RE",display="cite")`).  -->

For the fourth interval, which represents adult return probabilities from the ocean at any age, we also modeled affects of natal-stream vs downstream rearing life history rather than separating summer and fall sub-yearling life histories. As in previous intervals, we included affects of natal stream, their interaction with natal-stream vs downstream rearing life history. We include random year effects that were common among all fish and those that were unique to either natal-stream or downstream rearing fish.  

In survival intervals five and six, representing adult upstream migration, we did not model effects of juvenile life history pathway nor natal stream on survival, assuming that carryover effects from the juvenile life stage would be diminished by adulthood and due to the smaller sample sizes of returning adults. Instead, we modeled effects of adult return age on survival, as might result from size selective harvest or age-specific migration timing differences(`r tab_nums("variables",display="cite")`). No asynchronous year effects were modeled for upstream adult survival, assuming common year effects for all adults returning each year, due to the lower power accompanying the smaller sample size.



##### Environmental effects on survival {-}

We included effects of several environmental covariates on survival and return probabilities  (`r tab_nums("variables",display="cite")`). During the first interval, we included effects of average annual winter (November-February) air temperature and Wenatchee River discharge on survival of downstream-rearing life history pathways, allowing for different effects for summer and fall sub-yearling emigrants but assuming common effects across streams. We included effects of average water temperature and discharge at Rock Island Dam in April-May on survival during the second survival interval and at McNary dam in May-June on survival during the third interval. Similarly, we modeled the effect of average daily spill percentage across Rock Island, Wanapum, and Priest Rapids Dams in May-June on survival during the second interval, and across McNary, John Day, and The Dalles dams on survival interval three. Based on the findings of Crozier et al. [-@Crozier2021Climate], we evaluated the effects of the following three covariates on return rates from the ocean  (interval 4): sea surface temperature in an arc of the northeast Pacific Ocean defined by Johnstone and Mantua [-@Johnstone2014Atmospheric] during the winter prior to when fish enter the marine environment, a coastal upwelling index measured during the spring, and sea surface temperature off the coast of Washington State during the summer. Effects of all environmental covariates on survival during intervals two through four were allowed to vary for natal-stream vs downstream rearing fish  but effects were assumed to be common accross natal streams.


We assessed carryover effects of the density of female spawners within each natal stream on subsequent survival and return nates of their offspring, as might result from density-dependent effects on within-life-history size or timing of emigration. To do so, we included effects of observed counts of redds within each natal stream one year prior to initial capture for sub-yearling emigrants and two years prior for yearling emigrants on survival during intervals one through three and return rates in interval four  (`r tab_nums("variables",display="cite")`). We allowed for life-history and natal-stream specific effects of redd density. For intervals two through four, we modeled common effects of redd density on downstream-rearing fish (combined summer and fall sub-yearling) as with other aspects of the model.

  


#### Return ages {-} 

The conditional probabilities $\boldsymbol \psi_{l,y}$ of returning at ages three, four, or five given that a fish returned from the ocean were modeled using a multinomial logit link,  

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
mlogit(\boldsymbol \psi_{l,y}) &= \boldsymbol \alpha^\psi +  {\mathbf{x}^{\psi}_{l,y}}' \boldsymbol \beta ^\psi +  \boldsymbol \delta^\psi_y\\
\boldsymbol \beta^{\psi}_l &\sim N(\mathbf 0, \boldsymbol \Sigma_{\beta^\psi})\\
\boldsymbol \Sigma_{\beta^\psi} &= diag(\boldsymbol{\sigma^2_{\beta^\psi}})\\
\boldsymbol \sigma_{\beta^\psi} &\sim exp(\lambda_1) \\
\boldsymbol \delta^\psi_y &\sim N(0, \boldsymbol \Sigma_{\delta^\psi})\\
\end{split}
(\#eq:psipriors)  
\end{equation}


with age four as the reference year, where $\mathbf{\alpha}^\psi$ represents intercepts for ages three and five in multinomial logit space and $\mathbf{\beta}^\psi$ is a vector of coefficients for difference between natal-stream and downstream rearing fish. These differences were penalized using the same prior as that applied top the $\beta$s in the $\phi$ model in Equation \@ref(eq:survpriors), including the same value of $\lambda_1$. We modeled only synchronous random year effects $\mathbf{\delta}_y^\psi$ for adult return age probabilities due to limited power to fit idiosyncratic random year effects for different life history pathways. The synchronous random year effects for each return age in a given year were bivariate normally distributed with covariance matrix $\mathrm{\Sigma}_{\delta^\psi}$ to account for the inherent correlation in the proportions of the population that return at different ages in a given year (Buhle et al. 2018). The marginal standard deviations of the random year effects in the $\psi$ model were not penalized as they were in the $\phi$ and $p$ models.

#### Detection {-}

Detection probabilities were modeled as a linear combination of intercepts, covariate effects, and random year effects in logit space in the same way as survival probabilities, see Equation \@ref(eq:logitsurv). We fit unpenalized effects of juvenile life history pathway on recapture probability on the second capture occasion (lower Wenatchee river screw trap) due to the roughly 20-day difference in average recapture day of year observed between different emigration ages (`r fig_nums("timing",display="cite")`) and the possibility that some sub-yearling emigrants may have passed the trap location as sub-yearlings when it wasnât installed. We allowed for penalized effects of natal stream and its interaction with juvenile life history pathway on recapture probability in the lower Wenatchee screw trap, applying the same penalized-complexity prior as applied on the $\beta$s in the $\phi$ model, including the same value of $\lambda_1$ (`r tab_nums("variables",display="cite")`). The same penalized-complexity prior was applied to random year effects in the $p$ model as in the $\phi$ model as well, including the same values of $\lambda_2$

On the third and fourth recapture occasion (juvenile detection at McNary and Bonneville Dams), we allowed for penalized effects of natal vs downstream-rearing, natal stream, and their interaction on detection probability, as well as average daily discharge and spill percentage in May-June at McNary and Bonneville Dams respectively. Just as for survival probabilities, we allowed for different effects of flow and spill on detection probabilities for natal-stream and downstream rearing fish during occasions three and four. 

On the fifth and sixth recapture occasions, representing detections of upstream-migrating adults at Bonneville and McNary Dams, we modeled the effect of adult age  but not juvenile life history pathway nor natal stream, as was also the case for survival during these occasions. Adults of different ages could have different detection probabilities due to differences in their migration timing or if their different body sizes affect the proximity of tags in the peritoneal cavity to antennae in the fish ladders. 

Just as in the survival model, we modeled synchronous and idiosyncratic random year effects for recapture occasions two through four, while only synchronous random year effects were included for adult detection probabilities on recapture occasions 5 and 6. Detection probability on the final recapture occasion (Tumwater Dam) was fixed at 1.0 for identifiability and based on the auxiliary observation that  `r (top<-sum(mark_file_CH$instr_array!=0&mark_file_CH$Tum_A!=0,na.rm=TRUE))` out of `r (bottom<-sum(mark_file_CH$instr_array!=0,na.rm=TRUE))` fish (`r round((top/bottom)*100,2)`%) detected in adult fish ladders in main-stem Columbia River Dams and subsequently detected on in-stream arrays upstream of Tumwater Dam were also detected at Tumwater Dam.


<!-- ##### side note -->
<!-- It would be cool to extend this model to the instream arrays in the tributaries for adult detections someday. I think sample sized are too small to learn anything about straying with this data set, but it could have other advantages or come in handy with other data sets.  -->


<!-- ### Likelihood -->
<!-- A multistate Cormack-Jolly-Seber model is a hidden Markov model and the likelihood of a given capture history $x$ at occasions 1 through $T$ can be calculated using the forward algorithm, -->
<!-- $$\mathcal{L}\left(\theta\mid x_1,\ldots,x_T\right)=\delta\Gamma P\left(x_2\right)\cdots\Gamma P\left(x_{T-1}\right)\Gamma P\left(x_T\right)\mathbf{1}$$ -->
<!-- where $\theta$ is a vector of model parameters, $\delta$ is the initial-distribution vector of state probabilities at release, $\Gamma$ are state-transition probability matrices specifying the probability of transitioning from each state at time $t$ to each state at time $t + 1$, ${P}$ are state-dependent distributions that are diagonal matrices of conditional probabilities of observations given a fish is in each state, and $\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector of ones that sums the probabilities across states after the final occasion (See Zucchini et al. 2016 or McClintock et al. 2020 for details on the forward algorithm for hidden Markov models). Conditioning on release, the initial probability vector had a probability of 1.0 that fish were alive at release. The transition matrix $\Gamma$ for all intervals other than the marine-residence interval was, -->
<!-- $$\begin{array}{rccc}&  Alive   & Dead \\Alive & \phi^t_{l,a,y,s} &  1-\phi^t_{l,a,y,s} \\Dead & 0 &1 \\ \end{array}$$ -->

<!-- whereas the transition matrix for the marine-residence interval was -->

<!-- $$\begin{array}{rccccc} -->
<!-- & 3~year~old & 4~year~old  & 5~year~old & dead \\ -->
<!-- Alive &  \phi^4_{l,y}(\psi_{l,y,3}) & \phi^4_{l,y}(\psi_{l,y,4}) & \phi^4_{l,y}(\psi_{l,y,5}) & 1-\phi^4_{i,t,y} \\ -->
<!-- Dead & 0 & 0 &  0 & 1 \\ -->
<!-- \end{array}$$ -->

<!-- Once fish returned from the ocean, they could either remain in their current state or die, so the 2 x 2 transition matrix could be used again. The observation matrix was, -->

<!--  $$\begin{array}{rccc}&  Detected   & Not~ detected \\Alive &  p^t_{l,a,y,s} &  1-p^t_{l,a,y,s} \\Dead & 0 &1 \\\end{array}$$ -->
<!-- so the state dependent distributions $P$ used in the forward algorithm were diagonal matrices with the column of the observation matrix corresponding with the observed data value along the diagonal. -->


### Model fitting {-}

The likelihood of the data for a given set of parameters was calculated using the forward algorithm [@McClintock2020Uncovering; @Zucchini2016Hidden ], and the Laplace approximation of the marginal log-likelihood integrated over random effects was calculated by the package TMB in R for a given set of fixed effects values [@Kristensen2016TMB; @R2021R ]. We fit the model by minimizing the negative marginal log-likelihood with respect to parameters, which was conducted in R using the *nlminb* function and the TMBhelper package [@Gay1990Usage; @Thorson2020TMBhelper]. Standard errors of fixed and random effects, as well as derived quantities, at the maximum likelihood estimate were calculated by TMB using a generalization of the delta method. The fixed effects were the intercepts  $\mathbf{\alpha}$ for $\phi$, $p$ and $\psi$ as well as the standard deviation and covariance parameters for the hyper-distributions of the Gaussian random effects. The Gaussian random effects included the penalized coefficients \mathbf{\beta} and random year effects $\mathbf{\beta}$ and random year effects $\mathbf{\delta}$ and $\mathbf{\epsilon}$. To calculate confidence intervals for certain derived quantities, we conducted a parametric bootstrap where we sampled 5,000 fixed and random effects from a multivariate normal distribution defined by the maximum likelihood estimates and variance-covariance matrix. We then calculated derived quantities for each sample.
<!-- To generate confidence intervals for return-age simplex probabilities, we conducted a parametric bootstrap, sampling 5,000 parameter sets from a multivariate normal distribution defined by the maximum likelihood point estimates and covariance matrix. We then calculated the probabilities for each draw and found the quantiles corresponding with the 95% confidence interval.    -->


### Goodness of fit {-}

We assessed goodness of fit by examining scaled quantile residuals [@Dunn1996Randomized; @Gelman2006Data]. We simulated 250 data sets of the same size as the observed data by sampling from binomial distributions for survival and detection, and multinomial distributions for return age. Conditional simulations were conducted using the fitted model parameters and the fitted random year effects, and unconditional simulations were conducted using the fitted model parameters (including penalized coefficients) but drawing random year effects from their hyper-distributions. We summarized the simulated and observed data by the number of recaptures from each release group (life history by stream by year) and fish age at each occasion, and used the DHARMa package [@Hartig2021DHARMa:] to calculate scaled quantile residuals for the observed numbers of recaptures and interrogate the residuals for outliers and departures from their expected uniform distributions. 

In addition, we calculated *P* values for the model by sampling 500 parameter sets and calculating the Freeman-Tukey fit statistic,  $\sum_t{\sum_l{\sum_a{\sum_y{\sum_s{(\sqrt{d_{t,l,a,y,s}}-\sqrt{E[d_{t,l,a,y,s}]})^2}}}}}$,
for observed and simulated data with each parameter set, where $d_{t,l,a,y,a}$ is the number of observed or simulated detections at a given occasion for fish of a given juvenile LHP, natal stream, year, and age, and $E[d_{t,l,a,y,s}]$ is the expectation of that number of detections given the model and a specific parameter set. The *P* value was then then calculated as the proportion of parameter sets in which the Freeman-Tukey fit statistic for the simulated data was greater than the statistic for the observed data. We calculated *P* values conditional on the fitted random year effects and when sampling random year effects from their hypder-distributions.

## Results {-}



We found that the lowest looic occurred with $\lambda_1$ = `r round(mscjs_fit$dat_TMB$pen[2],2)` and $\lambda_2$ = `r round(mscjs_fit$dat_TMB$pen[1],2)`, and that with these value goodness of fit tests indicated that the model adequately fit the data. Scaled quantile residuals were approximately uniformly distributed based on visual examination of Q-Q plots, the numbers of outliers did not exceed the range of expectations, and plots of simulated residuals versus observations were approximately uniform (`r sup_fig_nums("GOF_cond",display = "cite")`--`r sup_fig_nums("GOF_uncond_boot",display = "n")`). There was evidence of underdispersion in the conditional residuals, however (`r sup_fig_nums("GOF_cond_disp",display = "cite")`). The *P* value conditional on the fitted random year effects was `r Free_Tuk_post_p$p` and when we sampled the random year effects from their hypder-distribution it was `r Free_Tuk_post_p_rand_year$p`, which do not indicate a lack of fit between the model and the data.

#### Mainstem Wenatchee River {-}


As expected, there were survival differences among juvenile life history pathways and natal streams during the first survival interval (`r fig_nums("time_1_surv", display="cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("mean_phi", display="cite")`). The summer sub-yearling emigrant life history, which spend the most time within the first interval, had the lowest median survival across streams (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHsummer", prob=T,include_95=T)`), followed by fall sub-yearling emigrants (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHfall", prob=T)`), and spring yearling emigrants (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHsmolt", prob=T)`).  Fish from the White River, which migrated through Lake Wenatchee on survival occasion one, had lower survival than fish from the other two natal streams during this occasion. The average effect across life history pathways of being from the White River was `r rel_chiw_sum` relative to being from the Chiwawa River and `r rel_nas_sum` relative to Nason Creek.


We identified relationships between environmental variables and survival during the first interval. (`r fig_nums("Env_cov", display="cite")`). Winter air temperature was negatively associated with survival of summer (`r print_param_CI("time1:win_air:LHsummer", prob=F,include_95=F)`) and fall (`r print_param_CI("time1:win_air:LHfall", prob=F,include_95=F)`) sub-yearling emigrant life histories, as was winter discharge but to a much lesser degree for summer (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHsummer:win_flow", prob=F,include_95=F)`) and fall sub-yearlings (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHfall:win_flow", prob=F,include_95=F)`).  

<!-- ,`r fig_nums("Redd_cov", display="cite")` -->
<!-- There was some evidence that higher densities of female spawners were associated with lower survival of summer sub-yearling emigrants from the Chiwawa River (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHsummer:streamChiwawa:redd_stan", prob=F,include_95=F)`) and Nason Creek (`r print_param_CI("time1:LHsummer:streamNason:redd_stan", prob=F,include_95=F)`) in the first survival occasion .  -->

#### Columbia River downstream juvenile migration {-}

```{r}
med_doy<-mark_file_CH %>% filter(LH!="Unk") %>% mutate(LH=ifelse(LH=="smolt","NS","DS")) %>% group_by(LH) %>% summarise(median(LWe_J_doy,na.rm=T),median(McN_J_doy,na.rm=T),median(Bon_J_doy,na.rm=T))
```

Both the timing and survival of fish during the second interval differed between natal-reach and downstream-rearing life histories. The median detection day at the mouth of the Wenatchee River was `r diff(pull(med_doy,2))` days earlier for downstream-rearing fish than natal-reach rearing fish across natal streams, and `r diff(pull(med_doy,3))` days earlier at McNary Dam (Figure 2). Between the mouth of the Wenatchee River and McNary Dam (survival interval two), downstream-rearing fish from the Chiwawa River had lower survival (`r time2_chiw_sub`) than natal-stream rearing fish (`r time2_chiw_smolt`) on average (`r fig_nums("time_2_3_surv", display="cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("mean_phi", display="cite")`). This was true of downstream-rearing fish from Nason Creek (`r time2_nason_sub`) as well, relative to natal-reach rearing fish (`r time2_nason_smolt`), but to a lesser degree. In contrast, downstream-rearing fish from the White River (`r time2_white_sub`) had higher average survival than natal-stream rearing fish (`r time2_white_smolt`). 

There was some evidence of density-dependent effects on survival in the second interval (`r fig_nums("Redd_cov", display="cite")`). Higher spawner densities in the Chiwawa River were associated with reduced survival of natal-reach rearing fish, with an effect size of `r print_param_CI("time2:streamChiwawa:age_classsmolt:redd_stan", prob=F,include_95=F,par_CI=TRUE)`). In Nason Creek, spawner densities were negatively associated with survival of downstream-rearing fish during the second interval, with an effect size of `r print_param_CI("time2:streamNason:age_classsub:redd_stan", prob=F,include_95=F,par_CI=TRUE)`). 

During the third interval (between McNary and Bonneville Dams), there was little evidence that average survival rates differed among emigration ages and natal streams (`r fig_nums("time_2_3_surv", display="cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("mean_phi", display="cite")`), and there was little evidence of effects of any environmental variables on survival rates (`r fig_nums("Env_cov", display="cite")`, `r fig_nums("Redd_cov", display="cite")`). As with any occasion, the lack of evidence of interannual variability in survival during interval three could have been due not to a lack of variability but to a lack of statistical power to detect it.


<!-- There was some limited evidence of a negative relationship between survival of sub-yearling emigrants and spill percentage during this interval (`r fig_nums("Env_cov", display="cite")`), and relatively little evidence of any effects of redd density on survival between McNary and Bonneville Dams (`r fig_nums("Redd_cov", display="cite")`). -->




<!-- \newpage -->

#### Ocean and upstream adult migration {-}

During the fourth interval, representing adult return rates from the ocean, downstream-rearing fish returned at higher rates (`r age.0_time4`) than natal-stream rearing fish (`r age.1_time4`) (`r fig_nums("time_4_surv", display="cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("mean_phi", display="cite")`) and differed in their response to environmental variables (`r fig_nums("Env_cov", display="cite")`). Return rates of downstream-rearing fish were positively associated with the coastal upwelling index in spring (`r print_param_CI("time4:age_classsub:cui.spr", prob=F,include_95=F)`), while there was no such relationship for natal-stream rearing fish (`r print_param_CI("time4:age_classsmolt:cui.spr", prob=F,include_95=F)`). Instead, return rates of natal-stream rearing fish were negatively correlation with sea surface temperature off the coast of Washington State during summer (`r print_param_CI("time4:age_classsmolt:ersstWAcoast.sum", prob=F,include_95=F)`), which was true for downstream-rearing fish as well but to a much lesser degree (`r print_param_CI("time4:age_classsub:ersstWAcoast.sum", prob=F,include_95=F)`). Downstream rearing fish also passed Bonneville Dam  `r diff(pull(med_doy,4))` days earlier as juveniles on average than natal-stream rearing fish.

The most common adult return age was four years for both natal-stream and downstream-rearing fish, but there were differences in the average return-age proportions between them (`r fig_nums("adult_props", display="cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("psi_mean", display="cite")`). The proportion of returning fish that returned at age three was higher among downstream rearing fish (`r  psi_tab %>% filter(age_class=="Age.0"&years==3) %>% select(4:6) %>% est_ci`) than natal-reach rearing fish (`r psi_tab %>% filter(age_class=="Spr.1"&years==3) %>% select(4:6) %>% est_ci`), while the proportion of returning adults that returned at age five  was lower among downstream rearing fish (`r psi_tab %>% filter(age_class=="Age.0"&years==5) %>% select(4:6) %>% est_ci`) than natal-reach rearing fish (`r psi_tab %>% filter(age_class=="Spr.1"&years==5) %>% select(4:6) %>% est_ci`). 

The model found little evidence of variability in upstream survival rates (`r sup_fig_nums("time_5_6_surv", display = "cite")`, `r sup_tab_nums("mean_phi", display="cite")`). Between Bonneville and McNary Dam (interval five), the median survival across ages was `r print_param_CI("time5", prob=T,include_95=T)`, and between McNary and Tumwater Dams (interval six) the the median survival across ages was `r print_param_CI("time6", prob=T,include_95=T)`.
