# Wenatchee-survival
This is the repository associated with the *in prep* manuscript: 
_Juvenile life history diversity is associated with life-long demographic heterogeneity in a migratory fish_
by Mark H. Sorel, Andrew R. Murdoch, Richard W. Zabel, Jeffrey C. Jorgensen, Corey M. Kamphaus,and Sarah J. Converse.

The purpose of the repository is to estimate survival, smolt-to-adult return rates, and return age probabilities for spring Chinook salmon marked as juveniles when emigrating from their natal stream. 

Please direct any questions or comments to me, Mark Sorel, at marks6@uw.edu.
