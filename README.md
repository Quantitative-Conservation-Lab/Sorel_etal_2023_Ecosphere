# Wenatchee-survival
Modeling the survival of fish tagged at screw traps in natal streams through their return as spawning adults.

Some wild juvenile spring Chinook salmon are captured when emigrating fromtheir natal stream, and are implanted with passive integrated trasponder (PIT) tags. Those fish may then be detected instream-antenna arrays within the Wenatchee River, and within facilties for passing fish upstream or downstream at Columbia River dams.
